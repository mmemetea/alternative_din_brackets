# More robust DIN brackets

While visually appealing, the existing brackets for the V2.4 are suffering from several problems:

- Their elasticity very much depends on the type of filament used;
- Their printing orientation is making the sliding tab prone to delaminate under duress;
- Their maximum opening course may barely be enough to get them on the rail without bottoming;

Inspired by a design from *mdkendall* found in Thingiverse (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2613804) and which can actually also be used to secure cables, I did a remix trying to respect the unspoken Voron design guides: no support and minimal filament use.

| Part Description     | Volume Original (cm³) | Volume Remix (cm³) |
| -------------------- | :-------------------: | :----------------: |
| RS-25 PSU Bracket    |         6.96          |        5.49        |
| Rpi Bracket          |         4.38          |        5.42        |
| LRS PSU Bracket (x2) |         9.30          |       11.73        |
| TOTAL                |        20.64          |       22.64        |

The new design is much more robust since the layers are orthogonal to the DIN metal edge and aren't forced to split if too much force is applied. There is actually a tab that physically limit the amount of displacement the part is able to take when fixing the bracket to the rail.
As a bonus, you now have a solid "click" that indicate positive engagement on the rail.

**Note**: You need to print them on the side.
